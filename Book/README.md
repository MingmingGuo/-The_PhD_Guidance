## HOW TO READ MORE RESEARCH ARTICLES?

### How to find the right papers?
Before reading a research paper, you must take the time to find a suitable one. So, I will share some tools I often use when searching for paper.

First of all, you need a theme. Let's say you want to study how transformers are applied to computer vision. Then, when I identify this topic, I will use [**_42 Papers_**](https://42papers.com) or [**_Arxiv Sanity_**](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com) and enter the keyword _“vision transformers”_ to search for papers on the same topic. Both of these sites are an excellent library of Arxiv's "selected" articles. Let's say you have a specific task in mind, such as "image matting", which deals with removing the background of an image and leaving only the object of interest as the foreground. In that case you can directly use [**_Papers With Code_**](https://paperswithcode.com/) like I did here [here](https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-matting), this page is also quite helpful, providing current best papers for the task you want to solve by providing the code to implement the task you need.

If you don't have a topic in mind, you can also choose a trending article using 42 Papers or [**_Daily Papers_**](https://papers.labml.ai/papers/daily ) — this is a tool that shows all trending articles on Twitter.

### Access the paper
You now have a few materials on your waiting list, but please don't read them all one by one. Instead, try the approach I suggest below, it can save you a lot of time:

- First, I will **_check all the documents at once and confirm that the article is worth reading or not_**. If the article references several inappropriate sources, that's probably not a good sign. Likewise, a quick tip to help figure out if an article is worth reading is to visualize the sources cited in the article. To do this, you can use a tool called [**_Connected Papers_**](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) to graph the connections between all the references in the document. paper, just enter the name of that paper. Why is checking source important? If the sources are connected and well known, this paper is trustworthy! Of course, this is just a subjective indication of whether an article should be read or not! Either way, you shouldn't completely judge an article based on its citation count.

- Once the papers have passed the first test with reliable references, **_quickly read the following_**: _Title_, _Abstract_, _Keyword_ and _Conclusion_. See if they really say what you're looking for. This way, you will quickly grasp the basics of the paper and help you decide if you want to continue reading it.
 
- In the 2nd round of selection, let's go a little deeper into the papers_**. Look at the Tables and Figures, read their captions. You can also take a quick look at the _Introduction_ and _Related Works_ sections to see if you find it interesting and well-done, but don't dive into _Method_ and _Experiment_ right away, it will take a long time to digest. knowledge and understand them. This second sifting will help you capture the depth and depth of the article!
- Our reading waitlist seems to have shrunk considerably. Now you just need to read the articles. However, don't just read it. Let's go deep into it. **_Take out a pencil, marker and find a quiet space to start reading._** Personally, I usually like to print out papers and read on paper, but it is quite expensive because there are papers. It's very long or it's not convenient to have a printer to print right away, so I'm switching to reading on a computer with PDF Adobe Acrobat Reader, with this software you can mark, draw and add notes on PDF.
 
- Also, you should **_Google words and concepts you don't understand and review citations when the author mentions_**. Ignoring these will compromise your understanding of the article as a whole. If you're just starting to read paper, take note of what you don't understand, and mark any areas that seem complicated or unclear to you. You can Google the questions right away, but don't get stuck if they persist after the 2nd reading! You can ask friends or if you don't know who to ask, you can look into communities or forums! There are many great communities where you can ask questions 24/7 and get answers e.g. Discord, Reddit, Linkedin, Facebook, Slack, etc. Joining one or more groups and talking to researchers like you will open up many things!

Now that you know how you approach the papers, let's move on to the recommended tools!

### Tools that any data scientist/AI researcher should have
I have mentioned the search tools I use such as: Arxiv Sanity Preserver, 42 Papers, and Papers With Code, but these tools are not helpful in understanding an article. While understanding an article will depend a lot on how much you dig into it, I've found that quite a few people explain these materials on YouTube videos. Indeed, you can refer to the channels of [**_Yannic Kilcher_**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew), [**_What's AI_**](https://www. youtube.com/c/WhatsAI), [**_Letitia_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/AICoffeeBreak), these channels dive into new research papers and explain them in a way clear. Of course, for a quick overview without diving into the theory, it is impossible not to mention [**_Two Minute Papers_**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg ). This will save you a lot of time, which is why I usually start by watching the video of the article before reading it. What's even better is that thanks to the paper being posted on YouTube, you won't need to google it anymore. Using the Google Chrome add-on called [**_crossminds.ai_**](crossminds.ai), the video will appear directly on the Arxiv page of the article you want to read. Isn't that great?! You should try it, I'm sure this is the best thing of 2020 that I discovered.

Similarly, using [**_Medium_**](https://medium.com/) is also a way to find paper abstracts and explanations for that paper whether it's a paper on Towards AI or Towards Data Science publications.

Another great tool involves applying paper to real-world tasks. If you found the paper on Papers With Code then good, the code is ready for you. If not, you may need to google a bit to find an implementation. Again, this great add-on will save you a lot of time on google and give you the code of any Arxiv research paper, if any. This extension is called [**_CatalyzeX_**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aiml-papers-with-code-eve/aikkeehnlfpamidigaffhfmgbkdeheil), it is available on both Google Chrome and Firefox . It gives you a link to the code directly on the Arxiv site, like crossmind, which is very practical.

These are all my best tips and tools for finding the right research articles and how to read them effectively while retaining as much information as possible. For me, repeated reading of the paper is definitely the best way to deepen understanding, that's why I recommend you to read the articles more than once if you really want to understand them.

After you find an article worth reading, you should save it in a reference management software like [**_Zotero_**](https://www.zotero.org/). The software is completely free and allows you to organize your papers, easily export references, save PDF files and more, all with a simple click. This is a handy tool that has been implemented in Word and Google Docs to automatically create your catalog.
